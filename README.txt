Compress images remotely for a better loading time

== Description ==

The core plugin functionality is optimizing the images in your library, you can either check a box and let us do all the work in the background, or you cand bulk select them.
All the api calls done are secured via a unique per image token.
The plugin also includes a lazy loading feature, it finds the images in your Wordpress site and adds the loading="lazy" tag.
For every image optimized we charge ONE CENT, but only if we reduce the actual size of that image.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ioptimizer.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
